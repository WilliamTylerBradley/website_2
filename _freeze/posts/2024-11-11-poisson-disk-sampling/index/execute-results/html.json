The code comes from [Robert Bridson's algorithm](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf). The posts from [Sighack](https://sighack.com/post/poisson-disk-sampling-bridsons-algorithm) and [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/) are also helpful resources to have.\n\nBasically, we'll start with one point then add another point within certain bounds from that one. We'll continue adding new points off of these points and so on as long as the new points aren't too close to any other point. When no new points can be added, the algorithm is done.\n\nThe points in this code will form a repeating pattern if allowed.\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>Code</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nWe'll start by importing the libraries.\n\n::: {#8fd73aa2 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport math\nimport random\nimport copy\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we'll create a `Point` class. It's basically just a holder for the location of a single point.\n\n::: {#0f8119b3 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass Point:\n    \"\"\"\n    Class for a singluar point\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    order: int\n        The order the point was inserted into the class list\n    x: float\n        x-location of the point\n    y: float\n        y-location of the point\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self,\n                 order: int,\n                 x: float,\n                 y: float) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructs a point\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        order: int\n            The order the point was inserted into the class list\n        x: float\n            x-location of the point\n        y: float\n            y-location of the point\n        \"\"\"\n        self.order = order\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __repr__(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"repr for Point class\"\"\"\n        return f'Point(order={self.order}, x={self.x}, y={self.y})'\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"str for Point class\"\"\"\n        return f'{self.order}: {self.x}, {self.y}'\n\n    def point_information(self) -> list:\n        \"\"\"Returns the Point information as a list\"\"\"\n        return [self.order, self.x, self.y]\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we'll start to build up the main code section.\n\nFirst is the `PoissonDiskSampling` class. This will hold the main code for the algorithm.\n\nWe'll first start out with the `__init__` method to set up the basic attributes. We'll need to keep track of:\n\n- `radius` to know how far to search around a point. This determines how close points are together.\n- `grid_height` and `grid_width` to know how big of an area to fill.\n- `sample_limit` to know when to stop trying for new points. This can affect how filled in the area gets.\n- `seed` to make it reproducible.\n- `initial_point` for a starting point, if one is provided.\n\nThese will be used to build the backgroud grid, `grid`. This is used to speed up comparing a potential point to the current list of accepted points, `points`. Finally, there will be a very similar list of points that are kept to base potential points, `active_list`.\n\n::: {#781c0cbb .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nclass PoissonDiskSampling:\n    \"\"\"\n    Class for poisson disk sampling points\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    points: list\n        The main list of points\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self,\n                 radius: float,\n                 grid_width: float,\n                 grid_height: float,\n                 sample_limit: int = 30,\n                 seed: int = None,\n                 inital_point: Point = None) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Constructor for the poisson disk sample\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        radius: float\n            The minimum distance between points\n        grid_width: float\n            The width of the grid\n        grid_height: float\n            The height of the grid\n        sample_limit: int\n            The number of times to try to find a new sample point for\n            each attempt with an active point.

It starts by determining the first point. Then uses a while loop to sample new points until all of the accepted points have been checked.\n\n::: {#a69ad0cb .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Set up the start\n        if seed is not None:\n            random.seed(seed)\n\n        if inital_point is not None:\n            self.insert_point(inital_point)\n        else:\n            self.insert_point(\n                Point(0,\n                      random.random() * self.grid_width,\n                      random.random() * self.grid_height))\n\n        # Continue until all points are checked\n        # Randomly pull a point that hasn't been removed each time\n        while self.active_list:\n            self.sample(random.randrange(len(self.active_list)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the previous code block, the `sample` method is called in a while loop. We'll now build up two other methods, `insert_point` and `check_neighbors`, to then get to `sample`.\n\nThe `insert_point` method takes a new point and inserts it into the `grid` and `points` list. The main difficulty is in checking the edges to have points repeat if needed.\n\n::: {#b4e923ff .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n    def insert_point(self,\n                     p: Point) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Inserts a new point into the self.points list and the self.grid\n        array.

If it is good, then it calls `insert_point`. If enough attempts are made without adding a new point, the first point is removed from `active_list`.\n\nFinally, the `sample_points` method pulls everything together and repeated the points pattern if requested.\n\n::: {#c5186e26 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef sample_points(radius: float,\n                  grid_width: float,\n                  grid_height: float,\n                  sample_limit: int = 30,\n                  repeat_percentage: float = .25,\n                  seed: int = None,\n                  inital_point: Point = None) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a list of points from poisson disk sampling with optional\n    repeats along the edges.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    radius: float\n        The minimum distance between points\n    grid_width: float\n        The width of the grid\n    grid_height: float\n        The height of the grid\n    sample_limit: int\n        The number of times to try to find a new sample point for\n        each attempt with an active point.
