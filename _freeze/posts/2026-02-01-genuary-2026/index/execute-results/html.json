I went with one prompt a week and kept the files [here](https://github.com/WilliamTylerBradley/genuary2026). I also focused on using SVGs for this run and kept all of them 100x100.\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>JAN. 1: One color, one shape</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nI used an arrow that followed the gradient from OpenSimplex noise. I created a base shape, copied it on to a hexagonal grid, then used transformations to rotate them.\n\n![Jan_01](Jan_01.svg){width=80%}\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>JAN. 10: Polar coordinates</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nThis is a random walk through polar coordinates. The arc length is consistent so the change in theta is different based on the radius.\n\n![Jan_10](Jan_10.svg){width=80%}\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>JAN. 17: Wallpaper group</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nThis is based on a herringbone pattern for group pg. The colors are based on RGB and modulo on row number.\n\n![Jan_17](Jan_17.svg){width=80%}\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>JAN. 27: Lifeform. A shape or structure that behaves as if it’s alive or growing.</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nBased on vegetation. This work uses cubic curves.\n\n![Jan_27](Jan_27.svg){width=80%}\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<center>\n<h2>JAN. 29: Genetic evolution and mutation.</h2>\n</center>\n<hr>\n\nThis has three polygons that grow until one reaches the outer boundary. This is my least favorite out of all of them.\n\n![Jan_29](Jan_29.svg){width=80%}\n\n",
