I recently passed the Cloud Digital Leader certification from Google. I made a set of flash cards for it and posted them to GitHub. Here's the [link](https://github.com/WilliamTylerBradley/gcp_digital_leader_fc). They can be imported into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

They could be improved. I wish I had made them more like the exam questions. For example, I have: 

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}

| Latency |
|---------|
| A measure of how long it takes a particular part of a system to return a result. It's important because it directly affects the user experience, changes could indicate emerging issues. It's values might be tied to capacity demands, and it can be used to measure system improvements. |

:::
::: {.g-col-2}

I should have broken this up into:

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}

| What is latency? |
|---------|
| A measure of how long it takes a particular part of a system to return a result. |

:::
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
:::

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}

| What do you measure to test long it takes a particular part of a system to return a result? |
|---------|
| Latency |

:::
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
:::

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}

| Why is latecy important? |
|---------|
| Because it directly affects the user experience, changes could indicate emerging issues |

:::
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
:::

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-2}
:::
::: {.g-col-8}

| What is measuring latecy useful for? |
|---------|
| It's values might be tied to capacity demands, and it can be used to measure system improvements. |
