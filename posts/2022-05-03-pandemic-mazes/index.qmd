This art project came out of my experiences during the pandemic. I thought the signs on grocery store floors were an interesting physical manifestation of the COVID rules. Especially since some places had clear signs but some didn't, some people followed the signs but some didn't, and some signs were consistent for a long time but some weren't. This same situation is reflected in the other rules where some are clear, followed, and consistent, but others aren't. 

So I decided to make a generative art project that creates random paths based on pandemic signs. For each image created, the maze generated has the same start and endpoints, but the path in between can be complicated or straightforward. On one end of the spectrum, the maze follows mostly straight lines into the middle and then back out of the maze with consistent signage. The other end has the maze meander all over with many different signs. There's a parameter for all of this code that causes that. Changes in this parameter can express experiences or match data for different regions/times.

The program works in five steps:

* Create a base maze
* Update the maze to double all the edges
* Move through all edges in one path
* Add in the images for signs
* Finally, add the background and save

<center><h2>Create a base maze</h2></center>

A five-by-five square of nodes sets up each maze. A data set of edges connect the vertical and horizontal neighbors. The set for the labyrinth is marked here. The maze always starts at the bottom middle node. After that, edges are selected, checked if they can be included or if it would cause the maze to connect in on itself, and marked as part of the maze or as discard. 

A parameter ranging from 0 to 1 determines how much the maze turns. A value of 0 yields a completely random maze and 1 for following a smooth labyrinth that spirals in and then back out to the start. Any value in between sets the probability of choosing a new step at random versus moving along the labyrinth.

The following image displays the base maze layout. The edges are numbered with their x1/y1 coordinates at their left/bottom and x2/y2 at their right/top. The labyrinth pattern is highlighted in blue.

For the final image, the path needs to start at one point, move through all the nodes, then exit at one other point. To ensure this capability, the path will travel through the maze and backtrack to the starting point. This is typically done using a graph setup, but I wanted to keep the table data structure. So instead of following those instructions, I take every edge and double for each direction. The code works by replacing all possible edges with either two parallel edges (if the edge was in the maze) or two perpendicular ones (if the edge was discarded).

```{r update_maze}

  # plus adds edges that stick out on the outside

    y1 = seq(1, 6) - 1

The following two images show a randomly generated maze and output for doubling the edges. The image on the left has the maze in red with all possible edges in blue. Note the extra blue edges are pointing out of the original five-by-five square. These will provide the walls for paths on the maze's outside edge. The image on the right displays the result of substituting every edge with a parallel set for maze edges and a perpendicular set for non-maze edges. So, each red line has two new black lines running next to it, while each blue line has two new black lines cutting through it. Note that the coordinates' ranges have changed from one to five to zero to eleven (everything is times two then minus one).

This image shows the cleaned-up final output for this function. The unconnected outside edges are removed. The start and end edges are added to the bottom middle with the connection between them severed.

Now, the edges from the previous step can be connected into one path. The path starts at the bottom middle and then moves to the next node. After that, the path connects to the unconnected node. Because of the previous setup, each node (except starting and end ones) connects to exactly two other nodes. So, we don't have to worry about hitting dead ends.

Creating the signs takes place before creating the maze. Each image name has three parts: sign, course, and direction. The sign contains essential information on what the image is. The course is how the path moves (straight, turn right, etc.). Direction is where the path is coming from (east,  north, etc.).

We'll need to determine how the path moves and which images display that to add the images. Using information from the previous and next steps, we can determine which direction the path moves and whether it turns or stays straight. This data can be paired with information from the image names to choose images that fit in the maze.

For each node on the path, several images could work. So, we select one at random from a bag. A parameter determines the number of available images in the bag. A value of 0 has all possible images on each draw. A value of 1 only yields one image for each course (straight vs. turn).

```{r get_image_data}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-summary: "[`get_image_data` function]"

get_image_data <- function(path, structure_parameter) {

  # Set up variables used to determine which images can be used
  path <- path[order(order), ]
  path[, ":="(previous_x = shift(x, type = "lag"),
    previous_y = shift(y, type = "lag"),
    next_x = shift(x, type = "lead"),
    next_y = shift(y, type = "lead"))]

  path[, ":="(course = fifelse(
    previous_x == next_x | previous_y == next_y, "straight",
    fifelse((y > previous_y & next_x > x) |
      (x > previous_x & next_y < y) |
      (y < previous_y & next_x < x) |
      (x < previous_x & next_y > y), "right", "left")
  ),
  direction = fifelse(
    x < next_x, "east",
    fifelse(
      y < next_y, "north",
      fifelse(
        x > next_x, "west",
        "south"
      )
    )
  ))]

  # set up bag to hold the images
  bag_pull <- function(this_course, this_direction, bag) {
    bag[course == this_course & direction == this_direction, 
        ][sample(.N, 1), file]
  }

  # fill bag
  bag <- data.table(file = list.files("signs", full.names = TRUE))
  bag <- bag[file != "signs/do_not_enter_straight_south.png", ]

  bag[, c("sign", "direction") := 
        tstrsplit(gsub("signs/|.png", "", file), "_(?!.*_)", perl = TRUE)]
  bag[, c("sign", "course") := tstrsplit(sign, "_(?!.*_)", perl = TRUE)]
  bag[, ":="(sub_course = fifelse(course == "straight", "straight", "turn"))]

  # filter down to a smaller amount if the structure_parameter is large
  bag_subset <- unique(bag[, c("sign", "sub_course")])
  bag_subset <- unique(bag_subset[
    , .SD[sample(.N, ceiling(
      (1 - (structure_parameter)^(1 / 4)) * (.N - 1) + 1))]
    , by = sub_course][, c("sign", "sub_course")])
  bag <- merge(bag, bag_subset, by = c("sign", "sub_course"))

  # add images from bag
  path[, image := bag_pull(course, direction, bag), by = seq_len(nrow(path))]

  # Start and end
  path[y == 0 & x == 6, image := "signs/wait_here_straight_north.png"]
  path[y == 0 & x == 5, image := "signs/do_not_enter_straight_south.png"]
}
```

After setting up the appropriate images, we only need to add a background. The background works by stacking small gray rectangles of various sizes with a low alpha value. This is supposed to resemble a grocery store floor.

```{r final_code}
