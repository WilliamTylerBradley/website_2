I recently worked on a generative art project around [Penrose tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling) patterns. As I worked through the functions, I decided to throw them into a package, `penrosetiling`. You can find it [here](https://williamtylerbradley.github.io/penrosetiling/). This package has base data sets and functions to substitute the pattern down through the shapes. There are also vignettes to help get started, use `purrr` for looping, and clean up images. Hopefully, it will work for you.
