I participated in [Genuary](https://genuary.art/) 2026 this year. I went with one prompt a week and kept the files [here](https://github.com/WilliamTylerBradley/genuary2026). I also focused on using SVGs for this run and kept all of them 100x100.

<h2>JAN. 1: One color, one shape</h2>
</center>
<hr>

I used an arrow that followed the gradient from OpenSimplex noise. I created a base shape, copied it on to a hexagonal grid, then used transformations to rotate them.

<h2>JAN. 10: Polar coordinates</h2>
</center>
<hr>

This is a random walk through polar coordinates. The arc length is consistent so the change in theta is different based on the radius.

<h2>JAN. 17: Wallpaper group</h2>
</center>
<hr>

This is based on a herringbone pattern for group pg. The colors are based on RGB and modulo on row number.

<h2>JAN. 27: Lifeform. A shape or structure that behaves as if it’s alive or growing.</h2>
</center>
<hr>

Based on vegetation. This work uses cubic curves.

<h2>JAN. 29: Genetic evolution and mutation.</h2>
</center>
<hr>

This has three polygons that grow until one reaches the outer boundary. This is my least favorite out of all of them.
