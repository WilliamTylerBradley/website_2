I recently passed the [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) exam. To help study, I created a set of flashcards using a reveal.js presentation from an Excel file of terms/definitions. The repo is [here](https://github.com/WilliamTylerBradley/az_900), with the presentation found [here](https://williamtylerbradley.github.io/az_900/az_900_flashcards.html#/) The terms come from the official skills measured document for 2021.

The R code is pretty simple. To set up the presentation, you’ll need the latest version of the revealjs package (Any version of reveal.js past version 4 should work for the r-stack option.). The following front-matter setup should work fine. You can turn on the shuffle option to shuffle the cards every time the document is re-knitted.

```{r page_setup}

output: 
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    incremental: false
    transition: 'none'
    background_transition: 'none'
    slide_level: 1
    css: custom.css
    reveal_options:
      controls: false
      slideNumber: false
      progress: false
      # shuffle: true # uncomment to randomize cards
    self_contained: false

```

The following code is the only markdown needed. It’ll read in the Excel file and loop through the rows to create the presentation. Each flashcard is a different slide. The term is the first fragment with the definition second because the r-stack places them on top of each other. The data-fragment-index is the same for both, so the term will fade out while the definition fades in on the same click. The line of breaks moves the term up a little. I just think it looks a little better.

````r
```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}`r ''`
library(readxl)
terms <- read_excel(here::here("az 900 Skills.xlsx"))

for(i in 1:nrow(terms)) {
  term <- terms$Term[i]
  definition <- terms$Definition[i]
  
  cat(paste("
    <section class=\"center\">\n
    <div class=\"r-stack\">\n
    <div class=\"fragment fade-out\" data-fragment-index=\"1\"><b>",
    term,
    "</b><br> \n <br> \n <br>
    </div>\n"))
  
  cat(paste(
    "<div class=\"fragment fade-in\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">",
    definition,
    "</div>\n
    </div>\n
    </section>"))
}
```

There are opportunities to color the slides based on the subject area, add additional information in the notes, or filter the terms.
